Importing montecarlo
--------------------
There are two methods for successfully importing this package into your desired python workspace:
1. **import montecarlo**  
Within your python file, you must then specify the package name as a prefix for calling any of the classes within the montecarlo package.

   Examples:  
    x = montecarlo.Die( )  
    x = montecarlo.Game( )  
    x = montecarlo.Analyzer( )

2. **from montecarlo import Die, Game, Analyzer**  
There are many variations on this menthod, such as "from x import * ", and they interact with the package in the same way. Using this method, you may call the classes within the montecarlo package directly.

   ```
   x = Die( )  
   x = Game( )  
   x = Analyzer( )
   ```
